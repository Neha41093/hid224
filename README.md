   title: Big Data Applications in the Hospitality Sector
   abstract: >
      The rise of Big Data in the field of Hospitality though recent, is by no means temporary. The hotel 
      industry is one which deals with millions of customers on a day-to-day basis and generates a plethora 
      of customer data through such interactions. It is also the sector which depends the most on customer 
      loyalty, and thus profits greatly through the analytical insights that Big Data has to offer. Keeping 
      this is mind, hotels today, whether they are big chains or small independent establishments, are using 
      data generated internally and on the web to develop strategies for better customer satisfaction, marketing 
      effectiveness, yield management and operational efficiency.
