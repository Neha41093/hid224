    abstract: "The rise of Big Data in the field of Hospitality though recent, is\
        \ by no means temporary. The hotel  industry is one which deals with millions\
        \ of customers on a day-to-day basis and generates a plethora  of customer\
        \ data through such interactions. It is also the sector which depends the\
        \ most on customer  loyalty, and thus profits greatly through the analytical\
        \ insights that Big Data has to offer. Keeping  this is mind, hotels today,\
        \ whether they are big chains or small independent establishments, are using\
        \  data generated internally and on the web to develop strategies for better\
        \ customer satisfaction, marketing  effectiveness, yield management and operational\
        \ efficiency. \n"
